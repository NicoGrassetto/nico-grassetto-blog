### Best Practices

```sql
-- Use connection pooling for better performance
-- Example connection string with pooling
Server=tcp:your-server.database.windows.net,1433;
Database=your-database;
Authentication=Active Directory Managed Identity;
Pooling=true;
Max Pool Size=100;
```

## Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database service designed for mission-critical applications that require low latency and high availability at any scale.

    EndPoints = { "your-cache.redis.cache.windows.net:6380" },
    Ssl = true,
    AbortOnConnectFail = false
};

// Set up Azure AD authentication
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
var token = await credential.GetTokenAsync(
    new TokenRequestContext(new[] { "https://redis.azure.com/.default" }));

configurationOptions.Password = token.Token;
var connection = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(configurationOptions);
```
