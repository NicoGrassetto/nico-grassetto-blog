---

Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout systems, but they serve different purposes. Understanding when to use each one is crucial for efficient web development.

## Flexbox: One-Dimensional Layouts

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts - either a row or a column.

### When to use Flexbox:
- Navigation bars
- Card layouts
- Centering content
- Distributing space between items

## CSS Grid: Two-Dimensional Layouts

Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts - rows and columns simultaneously.

### When to use Grid:
- Page layouts
- Complex card arrangements
- Magazine-style layouts
- Any layout that needs precise control over both dimensions

## Example: Combining Both

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}

.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

The best layouts often combine both Grid and Flexbox!
