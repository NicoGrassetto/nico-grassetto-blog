Astro is a modern static site generator that lets you build faster websites with less client-side JavaScript. In this post, we'll explore the key features that make Astro special.

## Why Choose Astro?

- **Fast by default**: Astro ships zero JavaScript by default
- **Framework agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework
- **Island architecture**: Only hydrate interactive components

## Getting Started

To create a new Astro project, simply run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

And you're ready to start building!
