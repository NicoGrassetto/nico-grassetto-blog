    x-axis ["Month 1", "Month 2", "Month 3", "Month 4", "Month 5", "Month 6"]
    y-axis "Productivity Score" 0 --> 100
    line "With AI Assistant" [20, 35, 50, 65, 80, 95]
    line "Traditional Coding" [20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]
```

This linear progression shows how developers can experience consistent improvement in their coding efficiency and output quality when leveraging AI tools in their development workflow.
