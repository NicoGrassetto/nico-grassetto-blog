Web components are the future of frontend development. They provide a way to create reusable, encapsulated HTML elements that work across different frameworks and libraries.

## What are Web Components?

Web components consist of three main technologies:

1. **Custom Elements**: Define new HTML elements
2. **Shadow DOM**: Encapsulated DOM and styling
3. **HTML Templates**: Reusable markup patterns

## Benefits of Web Components

- Framework independent
- Reusable across projects
- Encapsulated styling
- Browser native

## Example

Here's a simple example of a custom button component:

```javascript
class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
  }
}

customElements.define('custom-button', CustomButton);
```
