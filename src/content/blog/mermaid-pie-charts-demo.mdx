## Pie Chart Syntax

The syntax for Mermaid pie charts is simple:

```
pie title Your Chart Title
    "Label 1" : value1
    "Label 2" : value2
    "Label 3" : value3
```

### Key Points:
- Start with `pie title` followed by your chart title
- Each data point has a label in quotes followed by `:` and the value
- Values can be percentages or raw numbers
- Mermaid automatically calculates proportions
- Colors are assigned automatically but can be customized with themes

### Tips for Better Pie Charts:
1. **Limit categories**: Keep to 5-7 slices maximum for readability
2. **Use meaningful labels**: Make them descriptive but concise  
3. **Order by size**: Arrange from largest to smallest when possible
4. **Add context**: Include the total or time period in the title

These pie charts are perfect for:
- Survey results
- Budget breakdowns
- Time tracking
- Market share analysis
- Resource allocation
- Performance metrics

Happy charting! ðŸ“Š
