# Sales Data Analysis - Q4 2024

This quarter has shown remarkable growth across all our key metrics. Let's dive into the data to understand what drove our success.

## Monthly Performance Overview

Our monthly sales data shows a consistent upward trend throughout Q4. December was our strongest month, with revenue reaching $78k - a 73% increase from October.

## Product Category Analysis

Different product categories performed differently this quarter. Electronics led the way with 1,200 units sold, followed by Home & Garden products. This aligns with the holiday shopping season trends.

## Customer Segmentation Insights

Our customer base composition reveals interesting patterns. Returning customers make up 45% of our sales, showing strong customer loyalty. New customer acquisition (35%) exceeded our targets.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Growth Momentum**: 73% month-over-month growth in Q4
2. **Product Mix**: Electronics and Home & Garden are our strongest categories
3. **Customer Retention**: Strong returning customer base indicates good satisfaction
4. **New Acquisition**: Healthy new customer influx supports future growth

## Methodology

All data was collected from our sales management system and validated against financial reports. Charts are generated using Chart.js for interactive visualization.

The mathematical relationship between customer acquisition cost (CAC) and lifetime value (LTV) can be expressed as:

$$\text{LTV:CAC Ratio} = \frac{\text{Average Customer Lifetime Value}}{\text{Customer Acquisition Cost}}$$

Our current ratio of 3.2:1 indicates healthy unit economics.

## Looking Ahead

Based on these trends, we're projecting continued growth in Q1 2025, with particular focus on expanding our electronics and home & garden categories.
